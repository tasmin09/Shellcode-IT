              As a marketing manager, brand manager or C-suite executive you
              know how important it is to have a strong brand message. A
              compelling message can help you stand out in a crowded market and
              connect with customers on a deeper level. But creating such a
              message isn&apos;t always easy. It can be difficult to know where
              to start, and what elements to include. That&apos;s where Simon
              Sinek&apos;s Golden Circle comes in.
            </p>

            <p className="text-white font-clash-medium lg:text-xl">
              The Golden Circle is text-basea simple yet powerful framework that
              can help you create a brand message that truly resonates with your
              target audience. The framework consists of three key elements:
              Why, How, and What. The Why represents the company&apos;s purpose
              or belief, the reason why the company exists. This is often
              referred to as a mission statement. For example, Patagonia&apos;s
              Why is “to build the best product, cause no unnecessary harm, use
              business to inspire and implement solutions to the environmental
              crisis.”
            </p>
            <p className="text-white font-clash-medium lg:text-xl">
              The How represents th text-basee company&apos;s unique value
              proposition or the specific way it achieves its purpose. This is
              often referred to as a vision statement. For example,
              Patagonia&apos;s How is “Design, source, and manufacture apparel
              for the silent sports: climbing, surfing, skiing and snowboarding,
              fly fishing, and trail running.”
            </p>
            <p className="text-white font-clash-medium lg:text-xl">
              Finally, the What represent text-bases the company&apos;s products
              or services. In Patagonia&apos;s case the What is “Apparel, gear
              and accessories for climbing, surfing, skiing and snowboarding,
              fly fishing, and trail running.”
            </p>
            <p className="text-white font-clash-medium lg:text-xl text-base">
              By starting with the Why and working backwards, companies can
              create a message that truly resonates with their target audience.
              They can connect with customers on a deeper level and inspire them
              to take action. And this is where the Golden Circle is different
              from traditional approach; it is not about what you do or the
              products/services you sell, it&apos;s about why you do it.
            </p>
            <p className="text-white font-clash-medium lg:text-xl text-base">
              Have you ever stopped to think about why you buy certain products
              or services? It&apos;s probably because you share a belief or a
              value with that brand. For example, you may choose to buy organic
              produce because you believe in reducing your carbon footprint and
              supporting sustainable farming practices. Or, you may choose to
              buy a certain brand of car because you identify with the values of
              adventure and freedom that that brand represents. When you can tap
              into that emotional connection with your customers, you&apos;ll be
              able to create a powerful and compelling brand message that truly
              resonates with them.
            </p>
            <p className="text-white font-clash-medium lg:text-xl text-base">
              Simon Sinek&apos;s Golden Circle is not only a powerful framework
              for creating a brand message, it also helps in aligning the
              company&apos;s mission and vision statements. Many companies have
              a mission statement but fail to align it with their vision and
              messaging, the Golden Circle framework provides the guideline to
              do so. One great example of a brand that has successfully used the
              Golden Circle methodology is Apple. The company&apos;s Why is “to
              think differently and challenge the status quo”. Its How is “to
              design and develop innovative products that change the way people
              live and work.” And its What is “consumer electronics, computer
              software, and online services.” By starting with the Why and
              working backwards, Apple has been able to create a message that
              truly resonates with its target audience and inspire them to take
              action.
